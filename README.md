Hi, I’m @abdros<br />
I’m interested in Linux, Open Source, programming, networks and electronics.<br />
I’m currently learning Javascript and Git.<br />
I want to open source a library patron printing system that I use at my job. I will have more details about this soon.<br />
I may be reached at abdros_at_gmail_dot_com<br />
